TurboDuck for Textual 5
=======================

TurboDuck is a theme for Textual 5, an IRC client for OS X. This theme uses the Lato and Anonymous Pro fonts, which are loaded from Google Fonts. Ah, the magic of CSS. :)

Installing TurboDuck is pretty straight-forward. Simply do the following:

1. Download and extract the [latest TurboDuck version](https://github.com/TwoWholeWorms/TurboDuck/archive/master.zip).
2. Start Textual 5.
3. Open the Preferences panel with `⌘,` (`cmd`+`,`)
4. In the list on the left, find and expand `Addons`, then click `Installed Addons`.
5. Click the `Open in Finder` button.
6. Open the Styles folder.
7. Copy the extracted folder into here and rename it to `TurboDuck`.
